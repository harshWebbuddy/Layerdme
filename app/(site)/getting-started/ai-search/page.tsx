        <h1 className="font-bold text-lg">Step 2: Enter Your Query</h1>
        <p className="text-white/70 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          In the search bar, type in your query. This could be a question, a
          keyword, or a phrase you want to learn more about. Our AI Search
          Engine is designed to understand natural language, so feel free to ask
          as if you're speaking to a human.

        <h1 className="font-bold text-lg">Step 3: Analyze the Results</h1>
        <p className="text-white/70 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Press enter or click on the search icon. In a matter of seconds, our
          AI Search Engine will present you with a list of the most relevant
          results. These results are generated by our advanced AI algorithm that
          understands the context of your query and filters through billions of
          web pages to find the most accurate and helpful information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-lg">Step 4: Refine Your Search</h1>
        <p className="text-white/70 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          If you're not satisfied with the initial results, you can refine your
          search. Use quotations for exact phrases, the word 'AND' to combine
          searches, or 'OR' to expand your search. Our AI Search Engine
          understands these commands and will adjust the results accordingly.
